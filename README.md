### Bugs

- Post request (,,,,,) is not respecting parameters provided in request body. It is returning a lot more data. 
Expected behavior:
When supplying a properties array in the request body, the API should return only those metadata properties per subject.
Observed behavior:
The response always includes the requested properties (name, description, url), but also includes additional properties (e.g., decimals, policy, etc.) that were not requested.

Impact:
This defeats the purpose of property-level filtering, increases payload size, and contradicts standard API filtering semantics.

Recommendation:
The mock server should either:

Strictly filter to only the specified properties, or

Document clearly that it ignores properties for filtering purposes (though this would be suboptimal behavior).

===============================
 0 When subjects and properties are both empty, the API returns HTTP 200 and an empty subjects array â€” this is valid behavior but should be explicitly documented.

==============================
// possible defect - duplicate subject should usually mean data returned twice on post request

===============================



### ðŸŒŸ Stretch Goals (Beyond Scope)
- Parameterize environments to run against local, dev, or staging.
- Add structured request/response logging with verbosity levels.
- add test wrapper for error logging with logging levels.
- Generate and publish test coverage metrics to CI dashboards.
- Mock upstream dependencies for isolated negative-path testing.
- Move most of the tests to unit test level as less expensive to run (not worth doing for mocked data)
- performance test
- stress test with very large amounts of data on post
- validate all fields returned for correct types and structural integrity ie { value: string | number, sequenceNumber: number, signatures: [{ signature, publicKey }] }
âœ… Subjects returned in correct order (matches request order)	Optional
âœ… Duplicate subjects (e.g., same subject twice â†’ should appear once or twice?)	Optional
âœ… Case sensitivity of property names ("Name" vs "name") â€” do they silently fail?	Optional
âœ… Max-length strings in properties (e.g. very long description)	Optional
âœ… Valid but uncommon characters in returned values (Unicode, emoji, etc.)	Optional
